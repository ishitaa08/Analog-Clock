This project is a functional Analog Clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually represents the current time with moving hour, minute, and second hands, replicating the traditional analog clock design. 
The clock updates in real-time and offers a minimalist, aesthetically pleasing design.
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML5: To structure the clock and webpage layout.
CSS3: For styling the clock face, hands, and ensuring smooth animations.
JavaScript: To dynamically update the clock in real-time by calculating the positions of the hour, minute, and second hands based on the current time.
